Can you prevent the destruction of an attached persistent disk when the instance is deleted?  
**Yes, use the `â€“keep-disks` option with the `gcloud compute instances delete` command**  
No, attached persistent disks are always associated with the lifetime of the instance  
**Yes, deselect the option `Delete boot disk when instance is deleted` when creating an instance**  

For migrating data from a persistent disk to another region, reorder the following steps in which they should be performed:  
1. Attach disk  
2. Create disk  
3. Create snapshot  
4. Create instance  
5. Unmount file system(s)  
Choose the correct order  
(2, 3, 1, 4, 5)  
(4, 1, 2, 3, 5)  
(1, 3, 2, 4, 5)  
**(5, 3, 2, 4, 1)**  

Local SSDs
Compute Engine can also attach local SSDs. Local SSDs are physically attached to the server hosting the virtual machine instance to which they are mounted. This tight coupling offers superior performance, with very high input/output operations per second (IOPS) and very low latency compared to persistent disks.

Local SSD performance offers:

Less than 1 ms of latency
Up to 680,000 read IOPs and 360,000 write IOPs
These performance gains require certain trade-offs in availability, durability, and flexibility. Because of these trade-offs, local SSD storage is not automatically replicated and all data can be lost in the event of a host error or a user configuration error that makes the disk unreachable. Users must take extra precautions to backup their data.
